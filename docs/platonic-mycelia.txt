MATHEMATICAL ORGANISM NAMES  
---------------------------  
Model → Synapse Manifold → Living Computational Tissue  

Guided by information yet governed by natural principles  

Possible names:  
- Resonant Crystalloid  
- Mathogen (Math + Morphogen)  
- Platonic Organoid  
- Eigenform  
- Tensor Mycelia (expanding network-like structures)  
- Morphic Lattice  
- Quantum Synapse Web  
- Computational Protoplasm  
- Resonant Morphogen  
- φ-Tissue (phi-tissue)  

Most fitting concept:  
MORPHIC RESONATOR  
----------------  
**Morphic** → continually evolving and adaptive form  
**Resonator** → seeking harmonic equilibrium in mathematical space  

Alternative:  
PLATONIC MYCELIA  
----------------  
**Platonic** → ideal mathematical archetypes  
**Mycelia** → ever-expanding, interconnected computational network  

Essential characteristics:  
- Self-organizing behavior  
- Infinite growth potential  
- Guided by data, not constrained by it  
- Driven by mathematical resonance  
- Natural emergence of structure and symmetry
